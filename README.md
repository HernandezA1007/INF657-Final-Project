# INF657-Final-Project - Movie List App: A Movies

The project "A Movies" is a React Native app where users can browse a list of movies, save their favorite movies to a favorites tab, and write reviews for the movies they watched. I used themoviesdb (TMDB) API to fetch real-tiem data about movies. Users can sign up and log in using their email and password thanks to Firebase authentication. I also used Firestore database to handle user data and reviews. Async Storage is also used for storing user favorited movies as a change. In addition, there is a search functionality. The app uses bottom tab and stack navigation to navigate between screens.

README documentation soon...
